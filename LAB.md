Adventures in React State Game
===

Create a state-based adventure game! For this assignment you'll be creating a 
an adventure game with rooms to explore and challenges to solve and possibly monsters to fight.

**You can work solo or in teams of 2 for this lab**

* This game should have _at least_ four rooms or scenes that the player can move between. 

* Should track something about the player, like items or health, separate from the room being visited.

* Have items that the player can interact and at least one monster or character
the player defeats or interacts with.

* You need to provide ways for user to specify what they want to do (button, input, etc) 

* Use what you know plus JavaScript know-how to orchestrate changes through the game.

    1. State --> View (via `render` method)
    1. View Events --> Actions (via passing function props)
    1. Actions --> App Logic --> State Changes (via `handle<actiom>` methods on component)
    1. React takes care of: State Changes --> `i.` 

* The goal is to jump into React and try and build something more complex!

## Bonus

* Persist the data in localStorage to survive a browser refresh

## Rubric
* Functionally Correct (not buggy) **3pts**
* Game Creativity **2pts**
* Idiomatic use of React Components, Props and State: **5pts**
